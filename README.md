# Computational, Interactive and Visualized K-16 Mathematics

This repo contains an experimental project developed by Rongpeng(Ron) Li inspired by his tutoring experience at [School On Wheels, Inc](schoolonwheels.org). The ultimate purpose of this project is to develop a full set of [K-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%9316) mathematics courses so every kid would have the access to interactive mathematics materials online for free.

The framework for building this website is developed by [Ines Montani](https://github.com/ines). For more information about the technical sides of the framework, please refer to her original [repo](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course).

## üíÅ FAQ

**What's the difference between this project and Khan Academy?** 

Khan Academy is an amazing resource but I think I can do more. There are great benefits to teach with Python. All the course materials, if possible, are developed with Python code. Students can interact with the mathematical concepts and graphs with simple clicks. I believe there is a sweet spot between math and programming. Every kid can enjoy the excitement and joy.

**How do I improve the project**

1. If you have a technical improvement proposal or find errors like typo, please open an issue on github directly.
2. If you have an content improvement proposal, please send an email to [rongpenl@usc.edu](mailto:rongpenl@usc.edu).

**Are the resources free?** 

Yes. Feel free to use them NON-COMMERCIALLY.

**Why did I start this project?**

I initially started this project to help my student at School on Wheels.

## üõ£ Roadmap and todos

- [x] Port [Ines Montani](https://github.com/ines)'s repo and rebuilt the website.
- [x] Finish the deployment on Netlify and set up the CI/CD routines.
- [x] Get MathJax work.
- [ ] Get the multiple choice session work for one exercise, multiple choice questions.
- [ ] Get Matplotlib work.
- [ ] Develop two sample materials, one for introductory Python about how to use the website, one for graphing linear functions.
