<exercise id="2" title="Training and evaluation data">

To train a model, you typically need training data _and_ development data for
evaluation. What is this evaluation data used for?

<choice>

<opt text="Provide more training examples as a fallback if the training data isn't enough.">

During training, the model will only be updated from the training data. The
development data is used to evaluate the model by comparing its predictions on
unseen examples to the correct annotations. This is then reflected in the
accuracy score.

</opt>

<opt text="Check predictions on unseen examples and calculate the accuracy score." correct="true">

The development data is used to evaluate the model by comparing its predictions
on unseen examples to the correct annotations. This is then reflected in the
accuracy score.

</opt>

<opt text="Define training examples without annotations.">

The development data is used to evaluate the model by comparing its predictions
on unseen examples to the correct annotations. This is then reflected in the
accuracy score.

<exercise id="3" title="Creating training data (1)">

spaCy's rule-based `Matcher` is a great way to quickly create training data for
named entity models. A list of sentences is available as the variable `TEXTS`.
You can print it to inspect it. We want to find all mentions of different iPhone
models, so we can create training data to teach a model to recognize them as
`"GADGET"`.

- Write a pattern for two tokens whose lowercase forms match `"iphone"` and
  `"x"`.
- Write a pattern for two tokens: one token whose lowercase form matches
  `"iphone"` and a digit.

<codeblock id="04_03">

- To match the lowercase form of a token, you can use the `"LOWER"` attribute.
  For example: `{"LOWER": "apple"}`.
- To find a digit token, you can use the `"IS_DIGIT"` flag. For example:
  `{"IS_DIGIT": True}`.

</codeblock>

</exercise>

<exercise id="4" title="Creating training data (2)">

After creating the data for our corpus, we need to save it out to a `.spacy`
file. The code from the previous example is already available.

- Instantiate the `DocBin` with the list of `docs`.
- Save the `DocBin` to a file called `train.spacy`.

<codeblock id="04_04">

- You can initialize the `DocBin` with a list of docs by passing them in as the
  keyword argument `docs`.
- The `DocBin`'s `to_disk` method takes one argument: the path of the file to
  save the binary data to. Make sure to use the file extension `.spacy`.

<exercise id="6" title="The training config">

The `config.cfg` file is the "single source of truth" for training a pipeline
with spaCy. Which of the following is **not true** about the config?

<choice>

<opt text="It allows you to configure the training process and hyperparameters.">

The config file includes all settings for the training process, including
hyperparameters.

</opt>

<opt text="It helps make your training more reproducible.">

Because the config includes _all_ settings and no hidden defaults, it can help
make your training experiments more reproducible and others will be able to
re-run your experiments with the exact same settings.

</opt>

<opt text="It creates an installable Python package with your pipeline." correct="true">

The config file includes all settings related to training and how to set up the
pipeline, but it doesn't package your pipeline. To create an installable Python
package, you can use the `spacy package` command.

</opt>

<opt text="It defines the pipeline's components and their settings.">

The `[components]` block of the config file includes all pipeline components and
their settings, including the model implementations used.

</opt>

</choice>

</exercise>

<exercise id="7" title="Generating a config file">

The [`init config` command](https://spacy.io/api/cli#init-config) auto-generates
a config file for training with the default settings. We want to train a named
entity recognizer, so we'll generate a config file for one pipeline component,
`ner`. Because we're executing the command in a Jupyter environment in this
course, we're using the prefix `!`. If you're running the command in your local
terminal, you can leave this out.

### Part 1

- Use spaCy's `init config` command to auto-generate a config for an English
  pipeline.
- Save the config to a file `config.cfg`.
- Use the `--pipeline` argument to specify one pipeline component, `ner`.

<codeblock id="04_07_01">

- The argument `--lang` defines the language class, e.g. `en` for English.

</codeblock>

### Part 2

Let's take a look at the config spaCy just generated! You can run the command
below to print the config to the terminal and inspect it.

<codeblock id="04_07_02"></codeblock>

</exercise>

<exercise id="8" title="Using the training CLI">

Let's use the config file generated in the previous exercise and the training
corpus we've created to train a named entity recognizer!

The [`train`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#train) command lets you train a model
from a training config file. A file `config_gadget.cfg` is already available in
the directory `exercises/en`, as well as a file `train_gadget.spacy` containing
the training examples, and a file `dev_gadget.spacy` containing the evaluation
examples. Because we're executing the command in a Jupyter environment in this
course, we're using the prefix `!`. If you're running the command in your local
terminal, you can leave this out.

- Call the `train` command with the file `exercises/en/config_gadget.cfg`.
- Save the trained pipeline to a directory `output`.
- Pass in the `exercises/en/train_gadget.spacy` and
  `exercises/en/dev_gadget.spacy` paths.

<codeblock id="04_08">

- The first argument of the `spacy train` command is the path to the config
  file.

<exercise id="9" title="Exploring the model">

Let's see how the model performs on unseen data! To speed things up a little, we
already ran a trained pipeline for the label `"GADGET"` over some text. Here are
some of the results:

| Text                                                                                                              | Entities               |

Out of all the entities in the texts, **how many did the model get correct**?
Keep in mind that incomplete entity spans count as mistakes, too! Tip: Count the
number of entities that the model _should_ have predicted. Then count the number
of entities it _actually_ predicted correctly and divide it by the number of
total correct entities.

<choice>

<opt text="45%">

Try counting the number of correctly predicted entities and divide it by the
number of total correct entities the model _should_ have predicted.

</opt>

<opt text="60%">

Try counting the number of correctly predicted entities and divide it by the
number of total correct entities the model _should_ have predicted.

</opt>

<opt text="70%" correct="true">

On our test data, the model achieved an accuracy of 70%.

</opt>

<opt text="90%">

Try counting the number of correctly predicted entities and divide it by the
number of total correct entities the model _should_ have predicted.

<exercise id="11" title="Good data vs. bad data">

Here's an excerpt from a training set that labels the entity type
`TOURIST_DESTINATION` in traveler reviews.

```python
doc1 = nlp("i went to amsterdem last year and the canals were beautiful")
doc1.ents = [Span(doc1, 3, 4, label="TOURIST_DESTINATION")]

doc2 = nlp("You should visit Paris once, but the Eiffel Tower is kinda boring")
doc2.ents = [Span(doc2, 3, 4, label="TOURIST_DESTINATION")]

doc3 = nlp("There's also a Paris in Arkansas, lol")
doc3.ents = []

doc4 = nlp("Berlin is perfect for summer holiday: great nightlife and cheap beer!")
doc4.ents = [Span(doc4, 0, 1, label="TOURIST_DESTINATION")]
```

### Part 1

Why is this data and label scheme problematic?

<choice>

<opt text="Whether a place is a tourist destination is a subjective judgement and not a definitive category. It will be very difficult for the entity recognizer to learn." correct="true">

A much better approach would be to only label `"GPE"` (geopolitical entity) or
`"LOCATION"` and then use a rule-based system to determine whether the entity is
a tourist destination in this context. For example, you could resolve the
entities types back to a knowledge base or look them up in a travel wiki.

</opt>

<opt text="Paris should also be labelled as tourist destinations for consistency. Otherwise, the model will be confused.">

While it's possible that Paris, AK is also a tourist attraction, this only
highlights how subjective the label scheme is and how difficult it will be to
decide whether the label applies or not. As a result, this distinction will also
be very difficult to learn for the entity recognizer.

</opt>

<opt text="Rare out-of-vocabulary words like the misspelled 'amsterdem' shouldn't be labelled as entities.">

Even very uncommon words or misspellings can be labelled as entities. In fact,
being able to predict categories in misspelled text based on the context is one
of the big advantages of statistical named entity recognition.

</opt>

</choice>

### Part 2

- Rewrite the `doc.ents` to only use spans of the label `"GPE"` (cities, states,
  countries) instead of `"TOURIST_DESTINATION"`.
- Don't forget to add spans for the `"GPE"` entities that weren't labeled in the
  old data.

<codeblock id="04_11">

- For the spans that are already labelled, you'll only need to change the label
  name from `"TOURIST_DESTINATION"` to `"GPE"`.
- One text includes a city and a state that aren't labeled yet. To add the
  entity spans, count the tokens to find out where the entity span starts and
  where it ends. Keep in mind that the last token index is _exclusive_! Then add
  a new `Span` to the `doc.ents`.
- Keep an eye on the tokenization! Print the tokens in the `Doc` if you're not
  sure.

</codeblock>

</exercise>

<exercise id="12" title="Training multiple labels">

Here's a small sample of a dataset created to train a new entity type
`"WEBSITE"`. The original dataset contains a few thousand sentences. In this
exercise, you'll be doing the labeling by hand. In real life, you probably want
to automate this and use an annotation tool – for example,
[Brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/), a popular open-source solution, or
[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy), our own annotation tool that integrates with spaCy.

### Part 1

- Complete the token offsets for the `"WEBSITE"` entities in the data.

<codeblock id="04_12_01">

- Keep in mind that the end token of a span is exclusive. So an entity that
  starts at token 2 and ends at token 3 will have a start of `2` and an end of
  `4`.

</codeblock>

### Part 2

A model was trained with the data you just labelled, plus a few thousand similar
examples. After training, it's doing great on `"WEBSITE"`, but doesn't recognize
`"PERSON"` anymore. Why could this be happening?

<choice>

<opt text='It’s very difficult for the model to learn about different categories like <code>"PERSON"</code> and <code>"WEBSITE"</code>.'>

It's definitely possible for a model to learn about very different categories.
For example, spaCy's pre-trained English models can recognize persons, but also
organizations or percentages.

</opt>

<opt text='The training data included no examples of <code>"PERSON"</code>, so the model learned that this label is incorrect.' correct="true">

If `"PERSON"` entities occur in the training data but aren't labelled, the model
will learn that they shouldn't be predicted. Similarly, if an existing entity
type isn't present in the training data, the model may \"forget\" and stop
predicting it.

</opt>

<opt text="The hyperparameters need to be returned so that both entity types can be recognized.">

While the hyperparameters can influence a model's accuracy, they're likely not
the problem here.

</opt>

</choice>

### Part 3

- Update the training data to include annotations for the `"PERSON"` entities
  "PewDiePie" and "Alexis Ohanian".

<codeblock id="04_12_02">

- To add more entities, add another `Span` to the `doc.ents`.
- Keep in mind that the end token of a span is exclusive. So an entity that
  starts at token 2 and ends at token 3 will have a start of `2` and an end of
  `4`.
