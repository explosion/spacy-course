# String exercise

stringA = "Hello there!"

# your turn to check how long it is

print(len(stringA))

# now check its type

print(type(stringA))

# add two together. Can you add two strings together as adding two numbers?

stringB = " My name is replaceMe."

print(stringA + stringB)

# What is the first letter of the string?

print(stringA[0])

# How about the last one? 

print(stringA[len(stringA)-1])
