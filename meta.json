    "description": "This is an ambitious project. I aim to develop a full set of courses for K-12 mathematics. I am a mentor for an non-profit organization called School on Wheels. It helps connect tutors and homeless students, to help them catch up with their course work. Math is always the most difficult one for students. I find it most helpful to let kids see pictures, watch animations and most importantly manipulate what they see in order to learn math effeciently. This is why I started this project. Beyond this motivation, I think there is a strong need to introduce computational thinking in K-12 education.",
